In the realm of higher education in the United States, securing funding from the Federal Government stands as a crucial opportunity for educational institutions. The criteria for accessing such funds vary, with academic performance often serving as a pivotal factor. If an institution's default rate on student loans exceeds certain thresholds, it risks losing eligibility for federal financial aid.

The essence of the business problem lies in the quest to forecast default rates by leveraging the statistical data of educational institutions. By doing so, the aim is to unearth actionable insights into factors within an institution's sphere of influence. These insights could potentially aid institutions in devising strategies to curb high default rates and ensure they remain below the precarious threshold that puts federal funding at risk.

In this analytical pursuit, the methodology revolves around the construction of a predictive model utilizing multiple regression analysis. Through this approach, various factors such as student demographics, loan repayment terms, and institutional characteristics will be scrutinized to discern their impact on default rates. Think of it as assembling a puzzle where each piece represents a different aspect of an institution's operation, and the goal is to arrange them in such a way that reveals the bigger picture of default risk.

Just as a weather forecast relies on a multitude of data points to predict the likelihood of rain, this analysis amalgamates diverse institutional data to anticipate the probability of default. Much like a navigator consulting a map to chart the safest course through turbulent waters, institutions can utilize these predictive insights to steer their financial strategies away from the perilous cliffs of high default rates.
